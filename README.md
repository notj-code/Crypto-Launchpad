# LaunchPad Project


implement a very basic launchpad system that sell native tokens in exchange for wrapped Ethereum at a fixed price. Maximum number of tokens can be bought.
- Feature 2: token issuer can specify a token name, logo and ticker symbol, nothing else. Token is automatically created upon the token issuer initiating the fair launch and payment has been processed. 40% sent into a multi-sig wallet hardcoded. 30% sold during fair launch, and 30% kept in reserve to the liquidity pool creation.
